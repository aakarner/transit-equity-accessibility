# Tools for evaluating public transit equity and accessibility

This repository contains all code and scripts necessary to reproduce the analysis 
contained within the final FTA-sponsored report on multimodal connectivity performance 
measures. These tools can be used to calculate measures of *accessibility*, simply 
defined as the ease with which people can reach valued opportunities. 

Accessibility measures can be calculated in many different ways and different types
of measures require different data. Our intention here is to faciliate the calculation
and interpretation of many different types of measures that vary widely in their required
data. This approach will ensure that many different types of audiences can make use of 
the work, including including public transit agency employees (including those working in 
small rural settings to others in larger multimodal regions), academic researchers, 
and curious members of the public.  

## Case study location
For consistenncy, the scripts all evaluate the effects of a specific systemwide change 
in public transit service. The example case we use is the Houston METRO 
System Reimagining (SR) undertaken during spring 2015. SR was the first major
bus network redesign undertaken in the US and it entailed major changes to 
METRO's network. The overall goal of the SR was to improve the utility of the 
transit network so that more people would find it useful for more trips. 
Operationally, the number of all-day high-frequency routes was increased and
off-peak and weekend service was enhanced. But since the change was undertaken 
with a nearly fixed budget, some service had to be cut elsewhere in the network.
More information about SR is available here: <https://www.ridemetro.org/Pages/Reimagining-PlanMaterials.aspx>

Bus network redesigns are becoming increasingly common in the US and around 
the world as transit ridership continues to decline in many places. But the 
scripts here could be used to evaluate the effects of a one-off capital improvement 
as well. Any system change that can be represented in the [general transit feed
specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs) format can be evaluated. 


## Data and methods
